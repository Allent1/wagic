= Introduction =

As we spend time working towards release date while under feature lock, I think it might be a good idea to set aside this area for planning and organization of future projects. This could be a good way to keep on top of issues like, "Who do I talk to about...?" or "Is anyone working on..." without sending out multitudes of email. The emails and issue tracker are great for discussion, but as a quick overview of what's what this could be useful. 

This is definitely voluntary, and there are no real guidelines here... but I think anything that can't be summed up in a single sentence should probably be explained in detail elsewhere. Think of this as the project organization "cheat sheet". 

If this turns out to be more trouble than it's worth, we'll of course abandon it :)
